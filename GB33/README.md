# KIET Alumni Associate
**Introduction** 
<br>
The greatest asset any Institution can have been the Alumni system. Alumni are the 
people who represent the Institution in the real world. Alumni website is created for the 
students that have graduated from the Institution.

This is a web based application that allows former students to take advantage of the 
benefits and services that a Institution offers after graduation. The alumni network is 
becoming important in the development of the institution because of their vast potential 
that benefits both the Institution and the students. There are many benefits for being an 
alumni member of a college or Institution, some of these benefits are: keeping a person 
inform on the events that are organized by the Institution, and when some important 
events will be holding in the Institution. Another benefit is that information concerning a 
former student can easily be received and other members of the alumni community can 
be located without much stress. The student and alumni can communicate each other and 
they can get information about the events easily.

<b>Problem Definition </b>
<b>Existing System </b><br>
The existing system is built with numberless excel sheets that are created by each user. 
These sheets may be collated by an alumni organization and shared with all the alumni 
but this activity may not be frequent. The system is difficult to maintain on a regular 
process and it also have a privacy issues.<br> 
This does not allow efficient data management and retrieval process. A student willing to 
get information about others has to approach the college and obtain the details. Often the 
information may not be available and misleading.
